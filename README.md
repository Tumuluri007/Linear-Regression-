Linear Regression in Predictive Models
This repository contains a detailed example of implementing linear regression using Python. The example demonstrates how to predict the amount purchased based on page speed data. The code uses libraries such as numpy, matplotlib, and scipy to perform the regression analysis and visualize the results.
Overview
Linear regression is a fundamental technique in predictive modeling and machine learning. It helps in understanding the relationship between two continuous variables. In this example, we fabricate data to show a roughly linear relationship between page speed and the amount purchased. We then use linear regression to model this relationship and make predictions.
